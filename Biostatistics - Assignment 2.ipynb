To elaborate more to my reasoning, weight takes in many factors, but the most crucial factor would be how abundant and accessible the source of food for a population/ecosystem, and that accessibility would also be limited by wealth and health status. In conclusion, the CV of weight measure would have changed the most versus CV of height.*"
